I chose fly.io to deploy a simple Vite React test app.
I researched how to build the Dockerfile for a Vite app and tested it locally.

I then followed the fly.io documentation to deploy a Docker container.
I installed their CLI and it identifies Dockerfiles to speed up deployment.
I followed the instructions, but made sure to customize the resources to make them fit the free tier (downgraded from 1GB to 256MB RAM).

I had to edit the configuration after deploying as it set up port 80, while I had port 8080 in the EXPOSE instrucion.
After fixing this, the app was available.
