# Official Images

Defined by the mantainers of **Docker Official Images**. Some are mantained inside the `docker-library` organization, but others are mantained by external entities such as the Ubuntu and Node images.

# Deployment Pipelines

**CI/CD** (**C**ontinuous **I**ntegration and **C**ontinuous **D**elivery) automates the process of getting new code from a commit into production. With a pipeline in place changes in code are automatically tested and pushed out for delivery and deployment.
